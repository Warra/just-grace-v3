            <h4>Our Education Programme</h4>
            <p>
                Just Grace has adopted a holistic approach to our Education Programme with the over-arching goal of cultivating well-rounded individuals who are sufficiently equipped to pursue careers in many different fields. We also aim to instill in them a love for their community and an attitude of giving back in the hope that they too may one day be involved in community upliftment projects. The Programme intends to improve the lives of South Africans by providing underprivileged learners with tutoring, mentorship, computer literacy, job readiness skills and career guidance.
            </p>
            <h4>Tutoring</h4>
            <p>
                Just Grace organises mathematics tutoring sessions every Saturday morning. These sessions are aimed at refining and revising what the learners have already been taught by their teachers, as well as covering any crucial foundational concepts that the students may have missed out on. Our tutors are students from the surrounding universities as well as working professionals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Homework sessions take place on weekday afternoons for both science and accounting. Additional workshops are also arranged for other key subject areas through the course of the year.
            </p>
            <h4>Career Guidance and Job Readiness</h4>
            <p>
                The learners we work with are often be ill-informed, or misinformed about the various career opportunities available to them after school. Just Grace wishes to ensure the overall success of the learners and therefore encourages the learners to think carefully about their futures. Our career guidance programme aims to make sure that the learners are aware of the various options available to them post-school, including financial aid, tertiary institutions and learnership programmes. This is achieved through on-going vocational guidance as well as by motivating the learners to pursue their desired careers. This is usually supplemented by an annual careers day organised at the school.
                <br>
                <br>
                When appropriate, we will facilitate the necessary application process for entrance into a tertiary institution. In order to best equip the learners for life after school, we aim to ensure that the learners have the skills needed to obtain employment, university acceptance, or the like. This would include making sure that the learners are computer literate, and that they are competent with respect to: CV compilation, interview skills, business communication and workplace etiquette. This is achieved through our computer training and job-readiness programmes.
            </p>
            <h4>Financial Support</h4>
            <p>
                Just Grace believes that the lack of finances should never hold back a student who wishes to pursue a tertiary education. We therefore aim to source funding for our learners to cover their university fees.

            <h4>Mentorship</h4>
            <p>
                Just Grace is currently piloting their new mentorship programme. Mentors are assigned one to three learners who they meet up with one a month. Mentors play the important role of motivating and encouraging the learners in their school and personal lives. Mentors are there to support the learners by listening to them and showing that they are cared for and accepted.

            <h4>The Need</h4>
            <p>
                Our programme is implemented in Langa Township, Cape Town.
            </p>
            <h4>Why Langa Township?</h4>
            <p>
                Langa, meaning Sun, was established in 1927 for an intended 5000 residence, but now houses, according to the 2001 census 49,667 residents. The following stats evidence that unemployment and a lack of education are commonplace in the area:
                <br>
                – 71% of the population do not have a grade 12 education
                <br>
                – 49.28 % of the economically active (15-65) of the population are unemployed
                <br>
                – 72.07% of earners have an income of <= R1600 per month
                <br>
                <br>
                Compiled by Strategic Development Information and GIS from 2001 Census data supplied by Statistics South Africa
                <br>
                <br>
                The most effective, and possibly the only sustainable way to combat this high level of unemployment is through education. Unfortunately, the South African education system is failing its citizens hugely.
            </p>
            <h4>The South African Education Crisis</h4>
            <p>
                According to Eugene Daniels, a former district director in the Western Cape, only 1 in 10 pupils who pass Matric is likely to get a job.

            <p>
                According to a report released in 2013 by the World Economic Forum, South Africa’s education system has been ranked 140th out of 144 countries. South Africa’s maths and science education has been ranked second last in the world, ahead only of Yemen.
